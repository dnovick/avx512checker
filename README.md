# avx512checker
A utility to check which AVX 512 capabilities your CPU supports.

Currently, this is a Windows console application. At some point, I might add Linux support.

I wrote this after watching a set of creel videos about AVX512: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-mM6X5xnTY.

This VS 2019 project is configured to use NASM. So you'll need to install it before building it.
